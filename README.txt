Patrick Halter, 05/02/2018, Project 2, PHYS 640

A finite element comparative mesh solver for steady-state heat conduction

In order to run the project, run project2.py like you would any Python script.

Various configuration options exist in problem.cfg, and the project specification is
reproduced in project2.pdf. (For instructions on how to use problem.cfg, just open the file.)

The results required for the project are saved in the results directory (for the comparison tables) and the pics directory (for the contour graphs).

The libs directory contains necessary files to run project2.py.

The project requires a working install of Python 3, with the NumPy/SciPy stack. In case you don't have these, default results for the project specification have already been generated in the appropriate locations. Furthermore, you can open project2.py (and any other .py file) in your preferred text editor to view the source.
